## Cost-Benefit Analysis

1. **Development Time Savings**
   - Firebase: 3-4 months to MVP
   - Other platforms: 5-8 months to MVP
   - Self-hosted: 6-10 months to MVP

2. **Operational Costs**
   - Firebase: Mostly automated
   - Other clouds: 10-15 hours/month DevOps
   - Self-hosted: 20-30 hours/month DevOps

3. **Total Cost of Ownership (First Year)**
   - Firebase: ~$1,128/year + development
   - Other clouds: ~$2,500-3,500/year + development + DevOps
   - Self-hosted: ~$4,000-5,000/year + development + DevOps

## Conclusion
Firebase provides the optimal balance of development speed, cost-effectiveness, and built-in HIPAA compliance for our needs. While other options offer more control, they require significantly more development time, expertise, and ongoing maintenance costs. Firebase's approach allows us to focus on building the platform's unique features rather than managing infrastructure.
