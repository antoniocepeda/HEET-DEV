# Statement of Work: Diverse Health Experts Platform

## 1. Project Overview
Development of a HIPAA-compliant platform enabling laboratory experts (Microbiology, Clinical Chemistry, Hematology, etc.) to answer de-identified medical questions through a secure PHI separation system.

## 2. Project Objectives
- Create a secure, HIPAA-compliant healthcare consultation platform
- Enable anonymous medical question handling with expert responses
- Implement complete PHI protection through systematic de-identification
- Deliver validated responses within 24-48 hours
- Maintain strict security and compliance throughout the workflow

## 3. Core Workflow
Initial workflow outline, subject to refinement through stakeholder collaboration:

1. User submits question (provider or consumer)
2. System automatically de-identifies PHI
3. Admin assigns de-identified question to appropriate expert
4. Expert provides answer
5. Answer gets validated
6. System automatically re-associates answer with user

Note: This workflow represents the foundational process. During development, we will:
- Collaborate with stakeholders to optimize the workflow
- Incorporate client feedback and operational requirements
- Refine steps based on expert user testing
- Adjust processes to maximize efficiency while maintaining HIPAA compliance
- Document and implement approved workflow modifications

All workflow modifications will:
- Maintain strict PHI protection
- Preserve HIPAA compliance
- Be documented and approved by stakeholders
- Be implemented within the project timeline

## 6. Implementation Timeline
Target Duration: 4-6 months

Timeline flexibility factors:
- Stakeholder feedback during development (Changes requested by clients and experts)
- HIPAA compliance verification requirements (Time needed for security checks)
- Security implementation complexity (Building PHI protection systems)
- User testing adjustments (Changes based on how people actually use it)
- Integration and connection challenges (Making all parts work together securely)

Note: While these factors may affect individual phase durations, the overall project remains structured to ensure completion within 6 months, with an aggressive target of 4 months. Priority will always be given to security and HIPAA compliance requirements regardless of timeline considerations.

### Phase 1 (Target: Months 1-2): Foundation & Security

- Security architecture and authentication
- Role-based access control
- Database architecture
- Performance baseline establishment

### Phase 2 (Target: Months 2-3): Compliance & Features
- PHI separation architecture
- HIPAA-compliant data modeling
- User management system
- Core dashboard interfaces
- Basic safety checks and validation

### Phase 3 (Target: Months 3-4): Expert Systems
- Expert verification workflows
- Specialty-specific routing
- Communication system integration
- Performance tracking
- Quality metrics implementation

### Phase 4 (Target: Months 4-6): Integration
- Complete system integration
- Performance optimization
- Security hardening
- Documentation completion
- Launch preparation

## 7. Cost Structure

### Infrastructure Costs (Monthly)
Small Scale (50 questions/day):
- Core Services: ~$18-25/month
- Working Data: Included in free tier
- Compliance Data: ~$0.02/month
Total Range: $18-25/month

Medium Scale (250 questions/day):
- Core Services: ~$94-145/month
- Working Data: ~$10-15/month
- Compliance Data: ~$0.07/month
Total Range: $104-160/month

Large Scale (500 questions/day):
- Core Services: ~$240-300/month
- Working Data: ~$20-30/month
- Compliance Data: ~$0.14/month
Total Range: $260-330/month

### Data Storage Strategy
Working Data (2-year retention):
- Keeps recent data readily available
- Powers platform features and search
- Higher cost, but necessary for performance

Compliance Data (10-year retention):
- Uses ultra-low-cost storage
- 98% cheaper than working storage
- Example: 10 years of PHI at 500 questions/day costs only ~$1.40/month

## 8. Success Metrics
- System uptime: 99.9%
- Response time: < 2 seconds
- HIPAA compliance: 100%
- User satisfaction: > 90%
- Expert response time: < 48 hours


Note: All development will maintain strict HIPAA compliance and PHI protection throughout the entire workflow.
