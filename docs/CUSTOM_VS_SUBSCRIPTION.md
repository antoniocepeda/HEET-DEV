# Custom Development vs. Cloud Services Breakdown

Your platform is built primarily with custom code, leveraging cloud services only for essential infrastructure. Here's how it breaks down:

## Estimated Breakdown:
- Custom Development: ~80%
- Cloud Infrastructure: ~20%

## What This Means:

### Custom Development (80%)
This includes all the unique code and logic specific to your platform:
- User interfaces (website, admin dashboard, expert portal)
- Business logic (question routing, expert matching, PHI de-identification)
- Data models and relationships
- Security rules and access controls
- Integration between different components
- Custom algorithms and workflows

### Cloud Infrastructure (20%)
This refers to the underlying services we're using to host and run the custom code:
- Database (for storing data)
- Hosting (for serving the website)
- Authentication (for user login)
- Cloud functions (for running background tasks)
- File storage (for storing documents, images, etc.)

## Why This Approach:
1. Speed: We can focus on building your unique features without reinventing the wheel for basic infrastructure.
2. Cost: Pay-as-you-go model means lower upfront costs and better scalability.
3. Security: These cloud services come with built-in security features crucial for HIPAA compliance.
4. Reliability: Enterprise-grade infrastructure without the enterprise-grade price tag.

## Important Notes:
- The 80% custom code is entirely owned by you and can be moved to any infrastructure in the future if desired.
- The 20% cloud services are not a traditional "subscription" - you only pay for what you use, with costs scaling with your usage.
- This approach allows us to deliver a robust, scalable, and HIPAA-compliant solution much faster and more cost-effectively than building everything from scratch.
